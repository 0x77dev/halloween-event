# Visual Performance

This is visual performance toolkit built for [Halloween event @ Blivande (Oct. 29th â€“ 30th, 2022)](https://tickets.blivande.com/on/halloween001).

_Caution: source code is not clean, it missing a couple of scenes and it might be dirty._

## Quick overview

The visual part is handled by [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) and sound analysis by [Essentia.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/essentia.js), also live tuning and controls are handled by [WebMIDI](https://github.com/djipco/webmidi) which is intended to be used with [Arturia Beatstep Sequencer](https://www.arturia.com/products/beatstep/resources). The plan is to extend project with remote WebMIDI and maybe crowd tracking using Tensorflow.js.

DMX lights are controlled by ESP8266 with ESP-Dmx and ArtNet protocol libraries.
